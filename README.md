# Boss Voicer
Provides Voice Acting for the overhead & chatbox dialogues of the following bosses :  
-General Graardor  
-K'ril Tsutsaroth  
-Vet'ion/Calvar'ion  
-The Barrows Brothers  
-Lady Verzik Vitur  
-Sol Heredit & Minimus  

Due to their unreasonably fast dialogue pace, the following bosses have not been voiced :  
-Chaos Fanatic (talks every 2 ticks)  
-Crazy Archaeologist (talks every 3 ticks)  
-Deranged Archaeologist (talks every 3 ticks)  

I have also not voiced Commander Zilyana due to her high pitch of voice.  
Maybe I should find a woman to voice her someday, assuming it doesn't bust the space limit.  
  
The dialogue lines voiced are as follows...  

# General Graardor dialogue :
Split their skulls!  
Crush them underfoot!  
For the glory of the Big High War God!  
Brargh!  
All glory to Bandos!  
CHAAARGE!  
We feast on the bones of our enemies tonight!  
Death to our enemies!  
Break their bones!  
GRRRAAAAAR!  
(Death Noise)  
  
# K'ril Tsutsaroth dialogue :  
Kill them, you cowards!  
Zamorak curse them!  
Death to Saradomin's dogs!  
Rend them limb from limb!  
Flay them all!  
Attack them, you dogs!  
Forward!  
Attack!  
The Dark One will have their souls!  
No retreat!  
YARRRRRRR!  
(Death Noise)  

# Vet'ion & Calvar'ion dialogue :  
Die!  
Die, rodent!  
Hold still so I can smite you!  
You're mine now!  
Raaargh!  
You are weak! You are feeble!  
I will cut you down!  
I will end you!  
I will smite you!  
I've got you now!  
Stand still, rat!  
You can't escape!  
For the lord!  
You call that a weapon?!  
Now I've got you!  
Hands off, wretch!  
Take this!  
Too close!  
Back off, mutt!  
Grrrah!  
Time to feast, hounds!  
Hounds! Dispose of these tresspassers!  
Gah! Hounds! Get them!  
Now... DO IT AGAIN!!!  
DODGE THIS!  
PERISH, FOOL!  
YOU ARE POWERLESS TO ME!  
TIME TO DIE, MORTAL!  
FILTHY WHELPS!  
YOU'RE NOT BLOCKING THIS ONE!  
DEFEND YOURSELF!  
Must I do everything around here?!  
Fine! I'll deal with you myself!  
I'LL KILL YOU FOR KILLING MY PETS!  
Urgh... not... again...  
Urk! I... failed...  
I'll... be... back...  
This isn't... the last... of me...  
My lord... I'm... sorry...  
I'll get you... next... time...  

# Barrows Brothers dialogue :  
You dare disturb my rest!  
You dare steal from us!  

# Verzik Vitur dialogue :  
Oh I'm going to enjoy this...  
You think you can defeat me?  
There's nothing under there for you!  
Behold my true nature!  
I'm not finished with you just yet!  
You think this is over?  
(Death Noise)  

# Sol Heredit & Minimus dialogue :  
Let's start by testing your footwork.  
Not bad. Let's try something else...  
Impressive. Let's see how you handle this...  
You can't win!  
Ralos guides my hand!  
LET'S END THIS!  
I'LL BREAK YOUR BACK!  
I'LL CRUSH YOUR BODY!  
I'LL TWIST YOUR HANDS OFF!  
I'LL BREAK YOUR LEGS!  
I'LL CUT YOUR FEET OFF!  
Your light shines... brightly...  
A worthy... opponent...  
Ralos has smiled upon you...  
My compliments, champion...  
How disappointing...  
I knew you weren't the one.  
You almost had me excited for a moment.  
Your lack of coordination is concerning.  
Your light shines no longer.  
Maybe next time...  
Pathetic, really...  

# Cut Content
I had voiced the chatbox dialogue you get before your 1st Colosseum kc,  
as well as Verzik's greeting text (preceeding her "Oh I'm going to enjoy this" line),  
and the greeting text of the 2 Vyre Orators at the entrance of the Theatre of Blood.  
But, due to the 10mb limit of Runelite plugins, I had to cut out some things.  
If I wish to expand the plugin to cover more bosses in the future,  
I'll probably need to have the voice files downloaded at execution time.
