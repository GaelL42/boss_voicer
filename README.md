Sol Heredit: By Ralos, we finally have a worthy challenger.

Sol Heredit: Now let's see how you handle a real foe...  
Sol Heredit: You're back so soon? A lesser combatant would've retired in shame after the show you put on last time...  
Sol Heredit: But you're clearly different. Let's see what you have this time...  
Sol Heredit: What is it they say? Third time's the charm? Let's see if that's true.
