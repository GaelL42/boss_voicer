Maybe next time...  
Pathetic, really...

# A note regarding plugin legality  
On https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/third-party-client-guidelines?oldschool=1 ,  
the following is prohibited : "Adds additional visual or audio indicators of a boss mechanic  
except in cases where this is a manually triggered external helper."  
From a strict reading of this rule, the present Boss Voicer plugin would not be acceptable.  
However, considering that a similar plugin, Nex Nostalgia, has been approved  
(which I assume was because the sounds did actually exist in the original RS2 game),  
I remain hopeful that my plugin will be approved as well,  
as my goal is to provide entertainment & immersion, not in-game advantages.  
Now of course, the Grapple Special Overhead Text voicing may be particularly contentious here,  
but I am more than happy to remove those particular voice clips if that can make things easier.  
Mod Ash doesn't seem bothered by it ( https://x.com/JagexAsh/status/1810274382658351172 ),  
but still, it can be removed in case of concerns. Let me know, Runelite Dev team!  

# A note regarding sound quality & limitations  
Due to Runelite plugins having a maximum size of 10 megabytes,  
I had to save the sound files in a rather low amount of kilohertz.  
16000 Hz sound files ended up busting the limit,  
and 8000 Hz sound files sounded a little too bad,  
so 11025 Hz sound files was the best compromise available,  
though I apologize if it doesn't sound too great on your machines.  
In the future, I might adapt the logic to host the files externally,  
and thus download them at execution time (like the C Engineer plugin does).  
This definitely will be needed if I add any more bosses,  
as I am extremely close to the 10mb limit as it is! We shall see.  

# A note regarding other people's contributions
Initially, I had voiced every boss contained in this plugin (except Kree'arra),  
but a few people, after seeing my WIP Vet'ion video, proposed their voicing help.  
Because of the lack of guarantee that the plugin would be accepted,  
I did not want to make these enthusiastic voice actors work for nothing,  
so I had to politely decline their offers.  
One of them, though, still sent me his voice samples on a few bosses,  
and it turned out that his rendition of K'ril was much better than mine!  
Other bosses could probably be similarly improved with a better voice,  
especially Commander Zilyana (a woman would make for a less silly result for sure).  
If the plugin gets approved and I expand its coverage to more bosses,  
I'll definitely reach out to these other people as well.  

# A note regarding content not included
Due to their unreasonably fast dialogue pace, the following have not been voiced :  
-Chaos Fanatic (talks every 2 ticks)  
-Crazy Archaeologist (talks every 3 ticks)  
-Deranged Archaeologist (talks every 3 ticks)  
Having them voiced would likely be quite cacophonic!  
  
I have also not voiced Quest Bosses like Glod or the Fragment of Seren,  
due to plugin size limits (see the footnote about sound quality).  
If this plugin gets approved, I might make a separate "Quest Boss Voicer" plugin.  
  
I've also been asked to include things like Guardians of the Rift.  
Perhaps that could be part of a 3rd plugin, "Skilling Boss Voicer"? I dunno!
