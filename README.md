# Barrows Brothers Overhead dialogue :  
You dare disturb my rest!  
You dare steal from us!  

# Verzik Vitur & Vyre Orators dialogue :  
Welcome, one and all, to the Theatre of Blood.  
Verzik Vitur cordially invites you to the Theatre.  
Glory awaits those who enter the Theatre!  
Prove your worth in the Theatre!  
Only the Theatre can free you!  
You must stay and fight!  
Now that was quite the show! I haven't been that entertained in a long time.  
Of course, you know I can't let you leave here alive. Time for your final performance...  
Back again for more? I admire your perseverance. Shall we begin?  
Oh I'm going to enjoy this...  
You think you can defeat me?  
There's nothing for you there!  
There's nothing under there for you!  
Behold my true nature!  
I'm not finished with you just yet!  
You think this is over?  
(Death Noise)  

# Sol Heredit Chatbox dialogue lines (can only appear before your 1st kc) :
By Ralos, we finally have a worthy challenger.  
You've torn through multiple waves of combatants and you're still standing. I'm almost impressed.  
Now let's see how you handle a real foe...  
You're back so soon? A lesser combatant would've retired in shame after the show you put on last time...  
But you're clearly different. Let's see what you have this time...  
What is it they say? Third time's the charm? Let's see if that's true.  
To arms!  
You might be an incapable fighter, but at least you're persistent. Shall we?  
  
Also has a singular voiceline for Minimus ("Welcome, Grand Champion.") for debugging purposes.

# Sol Heredit Overhead dialogue lines (can appear on every attempt) :
Let's start by testing your footwork.  
Not bad. Let's try something else...  
Impressive. Let's see how you handle this...  
You can't win!  
Ralos guides my hand!  
LET'S END THIS!  
I'LL BREAK YOUR BACK!  
I'LL CRUSH YOUR BODY!  
I'LL TWIST YOUR HANDS OFF!  
I'LL BREAK YOUR LEGS!  
I'LL CUT YOUR FEET OFF!  
Your light shines... brightly...  
A worthy... opponent...  
Ralos has smiled upon you...  
My compliments, champion...  
How disappointing...  
I knew you weren't the one.  
You almost had me excited for a moment.  
Your lack of coordination is concerning.  
Your light shines no longer.  
Maybe next time...  
Pathetic, really...  
  
Also has some voicelines for Minimus when he greets you into the Colosseum.  

And that's it!
