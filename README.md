Now let's see how you handle a real foe...

Your lack of coordination is concerning.  
Your light shines no longer.  
Maybe next time...  
Pathetic, really...  

# A note regarding plugin legality  
On https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/third-party-client-guidelines?oldschool=1 ,  
the following is prohibited : "Adds additional visual or audio indicators of a boss mechanic  
except in cases where this is a manually triggered external helper."  
From a strict reading of this rule, the present Boss Voicer plugin would not be acceptable.  
However, considering that a similar plugin, Nex Nostalgia, has been approved  
(which I assume was because the sounds did actually exist in the original RS2 game),  
I remain hopeful that my plugin will be approved as well,  
as my goal is to provide entertainment & immersion, not in-game advantages.  
Now of course, the Grapple Special Overhead Text voicing may be particularly contentious here,  
but I am more than happy to remove those particular voice clips if that can make things easier.  
Let me know, Runelite Dev team!  

# A note regarding sound quality  
Due to Runelite plugins having a maximum size of 10 megabytes,  
I had to save the sound files in a rather low amount of kilohertz.  
16000 Hz sound files ended up busting the limit,  
and 8000 Hz sound files sounded a little too bad,  
so 11025 Hz sound files was the best compromise available,  
though I apologize if it doesn't sound too great on your machines.  
In the future, I might adapt the logic to host the files externally,  
and thus download them at execution time (like the C Engineer plugin does).  
This definitely will be needed if I add any more bosses,  
as I am extremely close to the 10mb limit as it is (~9.91)! We shall see.
